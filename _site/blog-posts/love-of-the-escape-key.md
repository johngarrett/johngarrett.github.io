## The love of the escape key
The uniqueness of the escape key?

- escape key & back button on android

#### prelude
You're composing a new tweet. As you're typing it out, you realize its something better left unsaid -- you close out.
You clicked the wrong button and a popup flys in, unrelated to what you wanted to do -- you close out.
You open your notification center, read through some messages then finish -- you close out.

These events all lead to the same outcome, closing out. Depending on the platform, these experiences can very drastically.
On iOS, you might dismiss "Compose Tweet" view with a swipe down gesture but swipe up to get rid of the notification center.
On the web, you might click the shadows surrounding the modal or hunt for a small x in the top left corner.

For every interaction, there must be an equal and consistent retraction... or something like that

#### the escape key
Android phones have (read: had) dedicated back buttons. This feature has been championed *word* for forever.
I didn't fully understand why until recently.

A couple years back, I swapped the escape key and caps lock key on all my devices. I.e. I hit caps lock and the computer presses escape.
Escape is essiental in vim but, it turns out, a blessing everywhere else.

#### examples

- quick calculation
    1. *begin* open spotlight search (or rofi on my dekstop): `mod+space`
    2. input my query: `cos(1.1114)` 
    3. *end* close spotlight: `escape`
- viewing an image in slack
    1. open image: `click` my trackpad with my thumb
    2. close image: `escape` with my pinky
- connect to wifi
    1. select a wifi network from the toolbar `click`
    2. wrong one `escape`
    3. select the right one & connect

this isn't universal. Using quick look on macOS is a good exception. space to open and space to close back again
siblings:
