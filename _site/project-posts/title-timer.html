<p>An open source project to help you keep track of your time spent on projects, tasks, etc.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>My use case is tracking hours for timesheets. Before getting to work I start a timer then pause it whenever I take breaks. At the end of the day, I record my time and reset the timers.</p>

<h2 id="general-notes">General Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For performance reasons, a timer doesn’t run as a background process. When you pause the timer, the overall time is calculated and displayed. This way is more accurate and efficient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timer names are saved into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserDeaults</code> and retrieved whenever the program starts. However, if you quit the program, timer states are not saved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OS X 10.11 or higher is required</p>
  </li>
</ul>
