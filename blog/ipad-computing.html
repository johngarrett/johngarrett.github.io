<h2>Preface</h2><p>I've wanted an iPad since the iPad 2 came out. There aren't many tangible reasons why, it just scratched an itch somewhere in my brain. It wasn't until 2018, the end of my freshman fall semester (5 years later), that I managed to buy one -- a first generation iPad Pro.</p><p>It was disappointing, full stop. I wanted more out of this machine. Here's how I, as a student, have contorted my iPad to fit my world.</p><p><em>Side Note: I've taken a year off university, so the examples below aren't reflective of new features, apps, online learning, etc.</em></p><h2>iPadOS 13.4</h2><p>In a podcast, <a href="http://twitter.com/futurepaul">Paul Miller</a> once said something along the lines of:</p><blockquote><p>"if a computer is a bicycle, then an iPad is a skateboard"</p></blockquote><p>I would amend his amendment by saying an iPad is a penny board and not so much a skateboard. You can only do a few tricks, and you look kind of dorky using it, but it's an amazing cruiser.</p><p>My current iPad Pro (2nd Gen 10.5") only gets upgraded when a jailbreak is available; a jailed iPad doesn't provide the same illusion of freedom.</p><h2>in the wild</h2><h3>Windowing</h3><img src="/blog-posts/images/ipad-computing/windows.PNG" alt="windowing"/><p>I use a tweak called <a href="https://mainrepo.org/bundle/milkyway2">MilkyWay</a> that lets you window applications. Imagine windowing in it's worst state, that's what this is.</p><p>Here's where I find it useful:</p><ul><li>watching live lectures and taking notes at the same time</li><li>floating zoom on top while I navigate around elsewhere</li><li>always accessible Spotify<ul><li>think: iTunes Mini Player</li></ul></li></ul><h3>"Development"</h3><img src="/blog-posts/images/ipad-computing/development.PNG" alt="development"/><p>I've managed to do a surprising amount of coding on my iPad. The image above is all native! I've installed some of the basics: <code>python3</code>, <code>pip</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>tmux</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>&amp;c</code>.</p><p>Sadly, I haven't managed to get <code>cargo</code> or <code>swift</code> working. I hope rustc's port to the ARM Macs does something for me.</p><p>Ranger, a favorite CLI tool of mine, compiles and installs pretty well. All of my vim, zsh, and tmux configurations (including plugins surprisingly) work here too.</p><p><code>NewTerm2</code> is one of the two (maybe three) terminal emulators offered on the cydia store. Truly, it kind of sucks. Graphical errors are common, you can't remap keys (iPad Keyboards don't usually have an escape button), the color scheme &amp; font can't be updated, so on and so forth†.</p><p>There is also an app <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM">UTM</a> that lets you virtualize operating systems on iOS. I mainly use this to run console only Arch Linux for when I need to use certain tools and binaries I don't have natively.</p><h3>Misc</h3><p>a few more things the iPad is great at:</p><ul><li>photo editing<ul><li>100x faster than my base line 2015 13" MBP</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>drawing</li><li>reading academic papers, textbooks, and articles</li></ul><p>There are a bunch more tweaks and apps I use but I'm cutting it short.</p><h2>Form Factor</h2><img src="/blog-posts/images/ipad-computing/magnets.jpg" alt="magnets"/><p>Each time I pick up my iPad, I'm seeing it for the first time again. It's the computer I <em>want</em> to love.</p><p>A few things on that:</p><ol><li>Magnets</li></ol><p>The magnets allow me to stick it to a slew of surfaces -- chalkboards, stovetops, and train windows. I have strips of metal glued on walls throughout my house allowing me to hang it like a frame.</p><ol start="2"><li>Screen Protector</li></ol><p>During school, I'm writing, sketching, and annotating all day. Nothing is more indicative of this than the 3 Pencil tips I've eroded through. With a 20-something dollar "paper" screen protector, stylus input feel s great -- I never got the appeal of writing on a glass screen.</p><ol start="3"><li>Text Input</li></ol><p>The iPhone sized keyboard is great, it's unobtrusive and allows swipe gestures. Using the full size screen keyboard makes me feel like Sam Flynn but my accuracy is very poor (I've found myself typing on the eastern keys with my right hand and the western side with my apple pencil simultaniously).</p><p>I tried the keyboard + trackpad case from Logetic and hated it. The external keyboard I use is a bluetooth one stripped from a 2010 iPad case.</p><img src="/blog-posts/images/ipad-computing/keyboard.jpeg" alt="keyboard"/><h2>Summary</h2><p>I summed it all up earlier -- the iPad is the computer I <em>want</em> to love.</p><p>I want its form factor, its speed, its battery life, to fit my needs.</p><p>It doesn't.</p><p>All that being said, a day in which I use my iPad is a good day.</p><h4>Footnotes</h4><p>†: you can use any ssh client off the App Store and connect to localhost. This would solve a lot of the problems (<code>Terminus</code> is way better than anything on cydia) but I haven't spent the time to do so yet</p></div></div></div></div></div>
